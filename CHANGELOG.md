# Changelog

Versioning convention: **major** version increments when new features are
added; **minor** version increments for corrections. The version appears in
every produced package filename (e.g. `DMS-v1.0-release.apk`) and in the
in-app About screen.

## v3.4 — build fixes (corrections -> minor increment)
- Fixed compile errors: AnalysisResult constructed with positional arguments
  placed risk events into the laneLines parameter in DriverAnalyzer and
  RoadAnalyzer; now passed as named arguments
- Added kotlinx-coroutines-play-services dependency required by
  SignAnalyzer's Task.await() (root cause of the unresolved-reference
  cascade in the CI log)
- Migrated deprecated kotlinOptions to the kotlin compilerOptions DSL
- Room: exportSchema = false to silence the schema-location warning

## v3.3 — Play Store package ID (correction -> minor increment)
- applicationId set to "com.DBM" for Google Play registration (Kotlin
  namespace remains com.rfsat.dms; the two are independent in Gradle)

## v3.2 — Play Store icon asset (correction -> minor increment)
- Added store-assets/DBM-play-store-icon-512.png: 512 x 512 px 32-bit PNG
  app icon required by Google Play Console registration, rendered from the
  same artwork as the launcher icon (4x supersampled, Lanczos downscale)
- store-assets/README.md noting the remaining listing assets (feature
  graphic, screenshots)

## v3.1 — rebranding (correction -> minor increment)
- Application renamed to "Driver Behavior Monitor" (short: DBM); package
  filenames now use the DBM prefix (e.g. DBM-v3.1-release.apk)
- New launcher icon: driver (head and shoulders) behind a steering wheel,
  as an adaptive vector icon with monochrome (themed-icon) support

## v3.0 — violation recording & history browser (new feature -> major increment)
- All violation types are recorded on the smartphone with evidential
  snapshots; speed violations now also attach the most recent road frame
- NEW History screen: browse all past records, newest first, grouped by day,
  filterable by severity (All / Critical / Warning / Info)
- Detail view per record: evidence image, full timestamp (ms), camera,
  severity, confidence, detail text and SHA-256 integrity hash
- Graceful handling of evidence files removed by 30-day retention

## v2.0 — speed-source resilience (new feature -> major increment)
- GNSS health tracking (availability + fix staleness): GPS used for
  positioning/speed whenever available
- NEW: visual speed estimation from the road-facing camera as automatic
  fallback when GNSS is unavailable (tunnels, urban canyons): block-matching
  optical flow on the road surface, median-filtered, with continuous
  auto-calibration of the px/s -> km/h scale against GPS while GPS is healthy
- Speed source (GPS / estimated / none) shown in the header; speeding
  tolerance widened and event confidence reduced when relying on the
  visual estimate

## v1.0 — initial feature release (Phase 1: phone cameras)
- Dual phone-camera capture: front camera = driver/interior, rear camera =
  road ahead (CameraX ConcurrentCamera, with time-multiplex fallback on
  devices without concurrent support)
- Driver-state detection: microsleep / prolonged eye closure (EAR + PERCLOS),
  gaze off road, mirror-check intervals (MediaPipe Face Landmarker)
- Road object detection + tracking + collision-risk proxy (EfficientDet-Lite0)
- Lane-marking detection: dashed / solid / double-solid classification,
  line-crossing, lane-drift and hard-shoulder heuristics
- Road-sign recognition v1: speed-limit reading via on-device ML Kit OCR
- Speed compliance: GNSS speed vs posted limit
- Driver-compliance score 0–100 with weighted penalties and clean-time recovery
- Evidential log: Room DB + SHA-256-hashed JPEG snapshots, 30-day retention
- Audio alerts (tones + TTS), foreground service, privacy disclosure, About
  screen with version display
- Raspberry Pi 3-node RTSP infrastructure retained for Phase 2 (`pi/`)
